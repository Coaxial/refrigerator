A simple NodeJS app that gets a Haiku using the `haiku` command by
[~vilmibm](http://tilde.club/~vilmibm/). It uses words from the Haiku to try
and fetch a relevant tunblr background.

Built with NodeJS and emberJS. [Code available on
GitHub](https://github.com/coaxial/refrigerator).

The name refrigerator comes from [this
